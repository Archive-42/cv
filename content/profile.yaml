To whom it may concern,
I would like to take this opportunity to express my interest in this position

I have a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from TCNJ, and I am an exceedingly creative and passionate engineer. I genuinely enjoy and excel in interpersonal communication, and as such, in collaborative settings, I often assume a hybrid role between creative design and leadership.  I have an innate knack for solving and simplifying novel problems, as well as tinkering with electronics until my vision has materialized. I am confident my unique combination of skills, disposition and experience make me the ideal candidate to work with your team.

Creating and learning how to use tools to enhance my musical pursuits has been the most gratifying pursuit of my life. Establishing a career working with my greatest passions in music and technology is a path that I have been building towards for well over a decade. My interest in electronics began when I was eight, with countless experimentation kits my dad brought home for me after I fell in love with a snap circuit kit one of my elementary school teachers used to teach the class about electricity. Within a year, I was soldering together devices like FM radio receivers and tiny amplifier & speaker combos on PCB boards in my basement “laboratory”. 

Please feel free to reach out to me using the adjacent contact information to schedule an interview. I look forward to speaking with you!

Sincerely, Bryan Guner
